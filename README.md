Hello out there, I am a new initiate to this world, making a transition from medicine.  This quest began for the purpose of seeking the "Holy Browser/OS" that allowed my escape from the never ending migraine which manifest from the clutter filling my drives with copies of copies of copies of backup copies.  I started with a simple version and quickly realized I was about to recreate my self with a new passion and thirst to understand more.  I have finished several coding classes, and enrolled in an upcoming boot camp, fast track workshops, not to mention devouring a small library of books, provided by various companies, eagerly assisting all those who seek the truth.  I love the research and the complexity, and analytical methods enlisted to reach each milestone, bringing with them a heavenly excitement, and a sense of ultimate satisfaction, the moment the solution unveils itself. All this, while still eagerly awaiting the next hurdle or puzzle challenge.  Thank you, for such great support and guidance.
